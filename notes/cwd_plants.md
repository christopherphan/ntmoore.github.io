#CWD prion in plants

Sent to MN Outdoor news, Dec 2017.  Note, a staff member at the Minnesota Department of Health told me in conversation that NOBODY should be eating prions, and I wouldn't be crazy to build an 8 foot fence around my garden. I sent similar letters to Target, Land of Lakes, Cargill, General Mills etc.  No response...

Readers might be interested in a recent article from Cell Reports, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.04.036>, 
lead author J. Pritzkow, 2015.  In it, the authors describe several studies investigating CWD prion transmission through plants.  The authors applied CWD prion containing fluid to the roots and leaves of grassy plants (barley).  Both roots and leaves were very effective at absorbing CWD prion.  The plants were also able to take CWD prion up from soil which was inoculated with CWD prion containing fluid.  The plants could also move the prion to their upper leaves. Finally, the authors gave the plants to some mice, who ate the grass and subsequently developed CWD.


We don’t know if Corn or Soybeans are able to take up CWD prion in the same way as Barley.  We also don’t know if spinach, beets, raspberries, apples, or other common garden produce can be similarly contaminated.  We also don’t know if there’s a real species barrier that prevents humans from contracting the disease.  However, in 5 years CWD will have finished its march across Wisconsin and will almost certainly be up against the Mississippi river.


Consider the black eye that genetically-modified foods have and then ask yourself what will happen to Minnesota agriculture if CWD prion starts showing up in Corn and Soybeans?  What will the response be towards deer, deer hunters, and game farms? How will you feel if YOUR tomatoes are at risk of containing CWD? Stop feeding deer and demand stricter regulations for game farms! The only alternative is extirpation.
